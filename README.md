# Scroll Story Final Project
================================

This repo includes the code of my final project at Coders Labs JavaScript Dev + React bootcamp.

Directories structure:
1. -css (CSS code compiled from Sass)
2. -img (images)
3. -js (JavaScript code - jQuery, ES6)
4. -sass (.scss files)
5. gulpfile.js (Gulp config file)
6. webpack.config.js (Webpack config file)
7. package.json (modules list)
8. lang.json (Polish and English versions of text)
9. index.html


As it is not the final version and I'm still working on it, there are some bugs to be fixed:
- mobile menu broke down at some point, it used to work
- language switching: PL / EN buttons to be moved to the right; a loop to be added; switch from currently used lang.js to lang.json
