# Scroll Story Final Project


This repo includes the code of my final project at Coders Labs' JavaScript Developer bootcamp.
Directories structure:
1. -css (CSS code compiled from Sass)
2. -img (images)
3. -js (JavaScript code - jQuery, ES6)
4. -sass (.scss files)
5. gulpfile.js (Gulp config file)
6. webpack.config.js (Webpack config file)
7. package.json (modules list)
8. index.html


I'm still working on this project in occasional pieces of free time, so there are a few things to be improved:
- smooth scrolling events (arrows and nav anchors) do not work in Firefox
- smooth scrolling event for mouse wheel works fine at first, but eventually it hangs up the browser
